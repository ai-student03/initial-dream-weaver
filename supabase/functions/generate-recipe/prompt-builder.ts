The user has the following:
Ingredients: ${ingredients}  
Goal: ${goals.join(", ")}  
Cooking time: ${cookingTime} minutes

Your task:
1. Suggest one realistic, healthy, and satisfying recipe that fits the goal and can be made in the available time.
2. Use only ingredients that logically go well together ‚Äî you do not need to use all of them.
3. Be creative: e.g., you can use just the yolk or just the white of an egg.
4. Each ingredient should be considered individually.
5. If this is a follow-up request, generate a completely different dish.
6. Make sure the instructions are clear, numbered, and easy to follow.
7. Estimate nutritional values as accurately as possible based on the ingredients used.

‚ùó Important:
- **Always include a recipe name.**
- **Always include preparation steps.**
- **Always include nutritional values.**
